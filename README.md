## 🏆 Vision

I believe **contributing to open source is the fastest way to grow**, both technically and professionally.  
This repo shows my **dedication, discipline, and consistency** for achieving a GSoC selection.  

My aim is not just to crack GSoC, but to become a **Software Engineer at Google** — and this is the foundation. 🚀
